This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook showcasing text classification on the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The project applies advanced machine learning techniques to categorize texts into 20 diverse newsgroup categories, encompassing areas such as technology, sports, politics, and religion.

Key Features:
- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing:** The notebook begins with a thorough analysis of the 20 Newsgroups dataset, including document count, category analysis, and average document length. It emphasizes data cleaning and preparation, setting a strong foundation for model training.
- **Model Implementation:** We implement a text classification model using the AWD-LSTM architecture. The model is fine-tuned for the specific nuances of the dataset, ensuring better adaptability to the diverse range of topics.
- **Training Process:** The notebook details the training process, including the use of TextDataLoaders for effective data handling, language model fine-tuning, and classifier training with a fine-tuned encoder.
- **Results:** The model achieves an overall accuracy of 67%, with varying performance across different categories. This section presents a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness, showcasing f1-scores, precision, and recall for each category.
- **Interpretation and Analysis:** Detailed analysis of the model's performance is provided, discussing high and low-performing categories, potential biases, and limitations due to computational resources. This section offers valuable insights into the model's behavior and areas for improvement.
